  { "content": "II. Surgical Robotics A. Robotic-Assisted Surgery Robotic-assisted surgery is one of the most prominent applications of robotics in medicine. It involves the use of robotic systems to assist surgeons in performing complex surgical procedures with enhanced precision and control. These systems typically consist of robotic arms equipped with surgical instruments and a console where the surgeon operates. In addition, Robots in the medical field are transforming how surgeries are performed, streamlining supply delivery and disinfection, and enabling providers to focus on engaging with and caring for patients. Intel offers a diverse portfolio of technology for the development of medical robots, including surgical-assistance, modular, and autonomous mobile robots." },
  { "content": "Historically, emerging in the 1980s, the first robots in the medical field provided surgical assistance via robotic arm technologies. Over the years, artificial intelligence (AI)â€“enabled computer vision and data analytics have transformed medical robots, expanding their capabilities into many other areas of healthcare. Robots are now used not only in the operating room but also in clinical settings to support healthcare workers and enhance patient care. For example, hospitals and clinics are deploying robots for a much wider range of tasks to help reduce exposure to pathogens during the COVID-19 pandemic." },
  { "content": "The use of robotics and automation also extends to research laboratories where they are used to automate manual, repetitive, and high-volume tasks so technicians and scientists can focus their attention on more strategic tasks that make discoveries happen faster. Streamlined workflows and risk reduction provided by medical robotics offer value in many areas. For example, robots can clean and prep patient rooms independently, helping limit person-to-person contact in infectious disease wards. Robots with AI-enabled medicine identifier software reduce the time it takes to identify, match, and distribute medicine to patients in hospitals. As technologies evolve, robots will function more autonomously, eventually performing certain tasks entirely on their own. As a result, doctors, nurses, and other healthcare workers will be able to spend more time providing direct patient care. The advantages of robotic-assisted surgery are manifold. Firstly, the use of robotics allows for greater dexterity and range of motion compared to traditional surgical techniques. Surgeons can manipulate robotic arms with precision and perform intricate maneuvers with ease. This level of precision is especially beneficial in delicate procedures such as cardiac surgeries or prostate surgeries. Robotic systems also provide surgeons with a 3D visualization of the surgical field, offering a magnified and detailed view. This improved visualization enables surgeons to navigate complex anatomical structures more effectively and make informed decisions during the procedure." }
